  "readme": "# seeing-is-believing package\n\nIntegrates Atom with [Seeing Is Believing](https://github.com/JoshCheek/seeing_is_believing),\nallowing Ruby programs to show you the result of each line of code that was evaluated.\n\nHere is an example session:\n\n![example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/josh.cheek/images/scratch/sib-example1.gif)\n\n[Here](https://vimeo.com/73866851) is a longer video that goes into more details.\n\n## Using the package\n\nKeybindings:\n\n* `Command+Option+B` to annotate every line\n* `Command+Option+N` to annotate just marked lines (mark them by placing `# =>` after them, or below them)\n* `Command+Option+V` to remove annotations\n\nSnippets (use SiB to play around with ideas without needing a complex environment):\n\n* `s_arb` in-memory ActiveRecord::Base code, so you can play with models without Rails.\n* `s_sinatra` Example Sinatra app with Rack-style invocation setup for you to play with.\n* `s_nokogiri` Parse html, play with css selectors, etc.\n* `s_reflection` Examples of useful reflection tools.\n\n\n## Install the Atom package\n\n* Atom -> Preferences -> Packages\n* Search for \"seeing is believing\"\n* Click \"install\"\n\nOr, you can do it from the command line `$ apm install seeing-is-believing`\n\n\n## You need [Seeing Is Believing](https://github.com/JoshCheek/seeing_is_believing) installed\n\nThis integrates into your specific environment, it doesn't come with the gem loaded by default.\nInstall it by getting into the environment you want, and running:\n\n```\n$ gem install seeing_is_believing\n```\n\nIf you're using rbenv, you'll need to `$ rbenv rehash` afterwards. You can check that it worked\nby running `$ seeing_is_believing --version`\n\n## Configuration\n\nAtom now loads your shell environment by launching a shell and printing the environment variables,\nwhich it then loads into its own environment variables. So, assuming that your system's `SHELL`\nvariable is set to your shell, and your shell sets your Ruby, then everything should just work.\nIf not, though, you can create your own executable to set up the environment and run Seeing Is Believing.\nA configuration option is left available for this purpose.\n\n### Flags\n\nYou can get a full list of flags by running `seeing_is_believing --help`\nThe most common and useful ones are going to be:\n\n* \"--alignment-strategy\" (I recommend \"chunk\")\n* \"--number-of-captures\" (say you have a line that executes in a loop, 1 million times,\n  you don't want to record all 1 million of those invocations, because it's too much information,\n  it would eat up your memory, maybe start paging, and just generally take a really long time to execute)\n* '--line-length' (how much output to show, use this to keep it from affecting editor performance or getting too spammy)\n* '--timeout' (say you accidentally have an infinite loop... don't want to wait around forever!)\n\n## <a href=\"http://www.wtfpl.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.wtfpl.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wtfpl.svg\" height=\"20\" alt=\"WTFPL\" /></a> License\n\n    Copyright (C) 2014 Josh Cheek <josh.cheek@gmail.com>\n\n    This program is free software.
