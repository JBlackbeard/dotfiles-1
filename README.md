#### Important Disclaimer

Open source software changes rapidly and usually with no concern for backwards compatibility.
I learned this **the hard way** when installing my dotfiles in a new Mac. Newest tmux and neovim versions
introduced changes that broke my configurations resulting in annoying bugs. Fixing these bugs sometimes takes
a persistent and time consuming research on relevant online resources.
Just keep this in mind while installing my dotfile configuration in your system. I did the best I could to document my
installation during an actual new setup.
